## Overview

Community Garden is an app that tracks Gardens, Plots, and Plants.

* Gardens have a name and an 'organic' column
  * Ex: name: "Turing Community Garden", organic: true
* Plots have a number, size, and a direction
 	* Ex: number: 25, size: "Large", direction: "East"
* Plants have a name, description, and days to harvest.
  * Ex: name: "Purple Beauty Sweet Bell Pepper", description: "Prefers rich, well draining soil.", days_to_harvest: 90

Some of the initial migrations and model set up has been done for you.

## User Stories

```
User Story 1, Plots Index Page
As a visitor
When I visit the plots index page ('/plots')
I see a list of all plot numbers
And under each plot number I see names of all that plot's plants
```

```
User Story 2, Remove a Plant from a Plot
As a visitor
When I visit a plot's index page
Next to each plant's name
I see a link to remove that plant from that plot
When I click on that link
I'm returned to the plots index page
And I no longer see that plant listed under that plot
(Note: you should not destroy the plant record entirely)
```

```
User Story 3, Garden's Plants
As a visitor
When I visit an garden's show page
Then I see a list of plants that are included in that garden's plots
And I see that this list is unique (no duplicate plants)
And I see that this list only includes plants that take less than 100 days to harvest
```

## Extensions

```
Extension,
As a visitor
When I visit a garden's show page,
Then I see the list of plants is sorted by the number of plants that appear in any of that garden's plots from most to least
(Note: you should only make 1 database query to retrieve the sorted list of plants)
```
